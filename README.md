# Codes for Finite-PINN Model

Codes for Finite-PINN examples are given. The offline preparation of data is conducted by MATLAB and the Finite-PINN model solving is conducted by Pytorch;

All the offline data can be generated by the MATLAB code in each foloder, and the prepared datasets are also free to download at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_3gYpzcBigS59wGJ6RFvpv1w1eMoumXZ?usp=sharing;
